## Request 1
Using bun test runner @src/bun.md , create a unit test for @src/index.ts

## Request 2
I think Bun has covered almost all node API. Ensure you don't use any of `node:`. for example, https://bun.com/docs/runtime/child-process, you can use Bun.spawn.

Also, move out template const into a separate file for reusability in both index.ts and test file.

## Request 3
refer to @src/bun-file.md

## Request 4
refer to @src/bun-path.md too

## Request 5
now run the test in ci/cd github action too

## Request 6
Can I get another badge for release.yml in @README.md
